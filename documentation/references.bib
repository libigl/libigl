	large step cloth simulation in the presence of constraints. This
	paper improves the robustness and efficiency of this MPCG algorithm.
	We prove convergence. For this, we recast the algorithm into a linear
	algebra setting, identifying its filtering procedure as an orthogonal
	projection. This leads not only to a convergence proof but also to
	a correction in the initiation stage of the original algorithm that
	improves its efficiency. We give an example to illustrate the performance

	a common spherical domain, while ensuring that corresponding user-highlighted
	features on each of the meshes map to the same domain locations.
	We obtain visually smooth parameterizations without any cuts, and

  abstract = {The bottleneck in most cloth simulation systems is that time steps
	must be small to avoid numerical instability. The paper describes
	a cloth simulation system that can stably take large time steps.
	The simulation system couples a new technique for enforcing constraints
	on individual cloth particles with an implicit integration method.
	The simulator models cloth as a triangular mesh, with internal cloth
	forces derived using a simple continuum formulation that supports
	modeling operations such as local anisotropic stretch or compression;
	a unified treatment of damping forces is included as well. The implicit
	integration method generates a large, unbanded sparse linear system
	at each time step which is solved using a modified conjugate gradient
	method that simultaneously enforces particle constraints. The constraints
	are always maintained exactly, independent of the number of conjugate
	gradient iterations, which is typically small. The resulting simulation
	system is significantly faster than previous accounts of cloth simulation
	systems in the literature.},

  annotation = {Deficient cloth-to-cloth collision response is the most serious shortcoming
	of most cloth simulation systems. Past approaches to cloth-cloth
	collision have used history to decide whether nearby cloth regions
	have interpenetrated. The biggest pitfall of history-based methods
	is that an error anywhere along the way can give rise to persistent
	tangles. This is a particularly serious issue for production character
	animation, because characters' bodies routinely self-intersect, for
	instance in the bend of an elbow or knee, or where the arm or hand
	rests against the body. Cloth that becomes pinched in these regions
	is often forced into jagged self-intersections that defeat history-based
	methods, leaving a tangled mess when the body parts separate. We
	describe a history-free cloth collision response algorithm based
	on global intersection analysis of cloth meshes at each simulation
	step. The algorithm resolves tangles that arise during pinching as
	soon as the surrounding geometry permits, and also resolves tangled
	initial conditions. The ability to untangle cloth after pinching
	is not sufficient, because standard cloth-solid collision algorithms
	handle pinches so poorly that they often give rise to visible flutters
	and other simulation artifacts during the pinch. As a companion to
	the global intersection analysis method, we present a cloth-solid
	collision algorithm called collision flypapering, that eliminates
	these artifacts. The two algorithms presented have been used together
	extensively and successfully in a production animation environment.},

  abstract = {In this paper we extend the standard method to derive and optimize
	subdivision rules in the vicinity of extraordinary vertices (EV).
	Starting from a given set of rules for regular control meshes, we
	tune the extraordinary rules (ER) such that the necessary conditions
	for C /sup 1/ continuity are satisfied along with as many necessary
	C/sup 2/ conditions as possible. As usually done, our approach sets
	up the general configuration around an EV by exploiting rotational
	symmetry and reformulating the subdivision rules in terms of the
	subdivision matrix' eigencomponents. The degrees of freedom are then
	successively eliminated by imposing new constraints which allows
	us, e.g., to improve the curvature behavior around EVs. The method
	is flexible enough to simultaneously optimize several subdivision
	rules, i.e., not only the one for the EV itself but also the rules
	for its direct neighbors. Moreover, it allows us to prescribe the
	stencils for the ERs and naturally blends them with the regular rules
	that are applied away from the EV. All the constraints are combined
	in an optimization scheme that searches in the space of feasible
	subdivision schemes for a candidate which satisfies some necessary
	conditions exactly and other conditions approximately. The relative
	weighting of the constraints allows us to tune the properties of
	the subdivision scheme according to application specific requirements.
	We demonstrate our method by tuning the ERs for the well-known Loop
	scheme and by deriving ERs for a radic 3-type scheme based on a 6-direction
	Box-spline.},

	that contains inconsistencies like cracks or intersections into a

	to fix the inconsistencies by perturbing the input only slightly,
	but they often cannot handle special cases. Volumetric algorithms
	on the other hand produce guaranteed manifold meshes but mostly destroy
	the structure of the input tessellation due to global resampling.
	In this paper we combine the advantages of both approaches: We exploit
	the topological simplicity of a voxel grid to reconstruct a cleaned
	up surface in the vicinity of intersections and cracks, but keep
	the input tessellation in regions that are away from these inconsistencies.
	We are thus able to preserve any characteristic structure (i.e. iso-parameter
	or curvature lines) that might be present in the input tessellation.
	Our algorithm closes gaps up to a user-defined maximum diameter,
	resolves intersections, handles incompatible patch orientations and
	produces a feature-sensitive, manifold output that stays within a
	prescribed error-tolerance to the input model.},

	of organic tissue or other objects whose genus is known beforehand.
	We describe a novel method to overcome this limitation while still
	preserving the favorable properties of the GDM setup. We achieve
	this by adding (sparse) topological information to the volume representation
	at locations where it is necessary to locally resolve topological
	ambiguities. Since the sparse topology information is attached to

	filter. The use of deferred shading techniques effectively avoids

	with a memory consumption of far less than 2 bits per point position
	which does not depend on the quantization precision. We present an
	efficient rendering algorithm that exploits the hierarchical structure
	of the representation to perform fast 3D transformations and shading.
	The algorithm is extended to surface splatting which yields high
	quality anti-aliased and water tight surface renderings. Our pure
	software implementation renders up to 14 million Phong shaded and
	textured samples per second and about 4 million anti-aliased splats
	on a commodity PC. This is more than a factor 10 times faster than

	The driving idea is to understand mesh reduction algorithms as a

	show how these requirements can be efficiently satisfied and discuss

  abstract = {Surface painting is a technique that allows a user to paint a texture
	directly onto a surface, usually with a texture atlas: a 1:1 mapping
	between the surface and its texture image. Many good automatic texture
	atlas generation methods exist that evenly distribute texture samples
	across a surface based on its area and/or curvature, and some are
	even sensitive to the frequency spectrum of the input texture. However,
	during the surface painting process, the texture can change nonuniformly
	and unpredictably and even the best atlases are static and can thus
	fail to reproduce sections of finely painted detail such as surface
	illustration. We present a new texture atlas algorithm that distributes
	initial texture samples evenly according to surface area and texture
	frequency, and, more importantly, maintains this distribution as
	the texture signal changes during the surface painting process. The
	running time is further accelerated with a novel GPU implementation
	of the surface painting process. The redistribution of samples is
	transparent to the user, resulting in a surface painting system of
	seemingly unlimited resolution. The atlas construction is local,
	making it-fast enough to run interactively on models containing oven
	100K faces.},

	continuous deformable shapes designed to support a new free-form
	modeling paradigm. The primitives autonomously deform to minimize

	and loads. The approach requires less user input than conventional
	free-form modeling approaches because the shape can be parameterized
	independently of the number of degrees of freedom needed to describe
	the shape. Both a curve and a surface finite element are developed.
	The properties of these geometric primitives have been engineered
	to support an interactive three phase approach for defining very
	fair free-form shapes as found in automobiles, ship hulls and car
	bodies. The shape's character lines or folds and edges are defined
	with deformable curve segments. These character lines are then `skinned'
	with a deformable surface. The final shape is sculpted interactively
	by applying loads to the surface to control the surface shape between
	character lines. Shapes created with this technique enjoy the advantage
	that they are already meshed for further finite element analysis.},

  abstract = {In the process of car body design, various surfaces are generated
	from given boundary curves. Depending upon the method of the surface
	generation and the quality of the boundary curves provided, the resulting
	surfaces may have global or local irregularities in many cases. Thus
	it would be necessary for the designer to evaluate the surface quality
	and to modify the surface or to use a different generation method
	based on the evaluation results. This capability is very important
	because the defect of the surface quality detected in the production
	stage will require the rework of the dies and will cause a big loss
	of money and time. A method of surface interrogation using reflection
	lines is introduced in this paper. We applied Blinn-Newell type of
	reflection mapping (Blin and Newell, 1976) to generate reflection
	lines on the trimmed NURBS surface. Since reflection lines are obtained
	from reflection mapping that uses simple and physically acceptable
	mapping algorithm, they can be efficiently used to simulate the reflection
	test on the real part in the production line.},

	full of technical challenges: creating more realistic results, achieving

	and simulating more complex garments. This paper provides an overview
	of the key procedures involved in the creation of clothed characters,

	stable yet also responsive. The stability of the technique allows
	the use of a large fixed time step when simulating all types of fabrics

	are strikingly realistic. Wrinkles form and disappear in a quite
	natural way, which is the feature that most distinguishes textile
	fabrics from other sheet materials. Significant improvements in both
	the stability and realism were made possible by overcoming the post-buckling
	instability as well as the numerical instability. The instability
	caused by buckling arises from a structural instability and therefore
	cannot be avoided by simply employing a semi-implicit method. Addition
	of a damping force may help to avoid instabilities; however, it can
	significantly degrade the realism of the cloth motion. The method
	presented here uses a particle-based physical model to handle the
	instability in the post-buckling response without introducing any
	fictitious damping.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a solution for texture mapping unparameterized
	models. The quality of a texture on a model is often limited by the
	model's parameterization into a 2D texture space. For models with
	complex topologies or complex distributions of structural detail,
	finding this parameterization can be very difficult and usually must
	be performed manually through a slow iterative process between the
	modeler and texture painter. This is especially true of models which
	carry no natural parameterizations, such as subdivision surfaces
	or models acquired from 3D scanners. Instead, we remove the 2D parameterization
	and store the texture in 3D space as a sparse, adaptive octree. Because
	no parameterization is necessary, textures can be painted on any
	surface that can be rendered. No mappings between disparate topologies
	are used, so texture artifacts such as seams and stretching do not
	exist. Because this method is adaptive, detail is created in the
	map only where required by the texture painter, conserving memory
	usage.},

	We present an extension to CULLIDE to perform intra-object or self-collisions

	subsets of objects and primitives, which considerably improves the
	culling performance. We have implemented our algorithm on a PC with
	an NVIDIA GeForce FX 6800 Ultra graphics card and applied it to three
	complex simulations, each consisting of objects with tens of thousands
	of triangles. In practice, we are able to compute all the self-collisions

	intersection curves, or other curves are used to judge the fairness
	of the surface. The surface fairness measure is derived by demanding
	that all the given curves should be fair with respect to an appropriate
	curve fairness measure. The method is applied to the field of ship
	hull design where the curves are plane intersections. The method
	is extended to the case where one considers, not the fairness of
	one curve, but the fairness of a one parameter family of curves.
	Six basic third order invariants by which the fairing measures can
	be expressed are defined. Furthermore, the geometry of a plane intersection
	curve is studied, and the variation of the total, the normal, and
	the geodesic curvature and the geodesic torsion is determined.},

  abstract = {Surface geometry is often modeled with irregular triangle meshes.
	The process of remeshing refers to approximating such geometry using
	a mesh with (semi)-regular connectivity, which has advantages for
	many graphics applications. However, current techniques for remeshing
	arbitrary surfaces create only semi-regular meshes. The original
	mesh is typically decomposed into a set of disk-like charts, onto
	which the geometry is parametrized and sampled. In this paper, we
	propose to remesh an arbitrary surface onto a completely regular
	structure we call a geometry image. It captures geometry as a simple
	2D array of quantized points. Surface signals like normals and colors
	are stored in similar 2D arrays using the same implicit surface parametrization
	- texture coordinates are absent. To create a geometry image, we
	cut an arbitrary mesh along a network of edge paths, and parametrize
	the resulting single chart onto a square. Geometry images can be
	encoded using traditional image compression algorithms, such as wavelet-based
	coders.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with an overview and analysis of methods for inspecting
	surface quality. The overview is done by a new classification based
	on common mathematical concepts yielding four groups of methods.
	Techniques based on curvature, such as colour-coded maps, lines of
	curvature, isolines of curvature, and focal surfaces are considered.
	They are followed by methods based on illumination models such as
	isophotes, lv-curves, reflection lines, highlight lines, and shaded-image
	rendering. Then, methods using special linear transformations are
	included: polar and orthonomic surfaces. The final method is that
	of contour lines. The results of a comparative analysis of all considered
	methods, such as their suitability for determining continuities,
	inflection points, and convex/concave regions, their speed, sensitivity
	to surface changes, and invariance to geometric transformations,
	which could be very interesting and useful for a user, are presented.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel constrained texture mapping method
	based on the harmonic map. We first project the surface of a 3D model
	on a planar domain by an angle-based-flattening technique and perform
	a parametrization. The user then specifies interactively the constraints
	between the selected feature points on the parametric domain of the
	3D model and the corresponding pixels on the texture image; the texture
	coordinates of other sample points on the 3D model are determined
	based on harmonic mapping between the parametric domain of the model
	and the texture image; finally we apply an adaptive local mapping
	refinement to improve the rendering result in real-time. Compared
	with other interactive methods, our method provides an analytically
	accurate solution to the problem, and the energy minimization characteristic
	of the harmonic map reduces the potential distortion that may result
	in the constrained texture mapping. Experimental data demonstrate
	good rendering effects generated by the presented algorithm. [All

	of this model, we propose triangular NURBS, the rational generalization
	of triangular B-splines, with weights as additional degrees of freedom.
	Fixing the weights to unity reduces triangular NURBS to triangular
	B-splines. Conventional geometric design with triangular NURBS can
	be laborious, since the user must manually adjust the many control
	points and weights. To ameliorate the design process, we develop
	a new model based on the elegant triangular NURBS geometry and principles

	triangular NURBS with the demonstrated conveniences of interaction
	within a physics-based framework. The dynamic behavior of the model
	results from the numerical integration of differential equations
	of motion that govern the temporal evolution of control points and
	weights in response to applied forces and constraints. This results
	in physically meaningful hence highly intuitive shape variation.
	We apply Lagrangian mechanics to formulate the equations of motion
	of dynamic triangular NURBS and finite element analysis to reduce

  abstract = {Building intuitive user-interfaces for virtual reality applications
	is a difficult task, as one of the main purposes is to provide a
	natural, yet efficient input device to interact with the virtual
	environment. One particularly interesting approach is to track and
	retarget the complete motion of a subject. Established techniques
	for full body motion capture like optical motion tracking exist.
	However, due to their computational complexity and their reliance
	on pre-specified models, they fail to meet the demanding requirements
	of virtual reality environments such as real-time response, immersion,
	and ad hoc configurability. Our goal is to support the use of motion
	capture as a general input device for virtual reality applications.
	In this paper we present a self-calibrating framework for optical
	motion capture, enabling the reconstruction and tracking of arbitrary
	articulated objects in real-time. Our method automatically estimates
	all relevant model parameters on-the-fly without any information
	on the initial tracking setup or the marker distribution, and computes
	the geometry and topology of multiple tracked skeletons. Moreover,
	we show how the model can make the motion capture phase robust against
	marker occlusions by exploiting the redundancy in the skeleton model
	and by reconstructing missing inner limbs and joints of the subject
	from partial information. Meeting the above requirements our system
	is well applicable to a wide range of virtual reality based applications,
	where unconstrained tracking and flexible retargeting of motion data
	is desirable.},

	minimal latency of mesh updates for varying viewpoints. Furthermore,
	we reduce the per-client session data on the server side by using
	a special data structure for encoding which vertices have already
	been transmitted to each client. We provide an analytic comparison
	of several view-dependent streaming frameworks and show that our

  abstract = {Multiresolution geometry streaming has been well studied in recent
	years. The client can progressively visualize a triangle mesh from
	the coarsest resolution to the finest one while a server successively
	transmits detail information. However, the streaming order of the
	detail data usually depends only on the geometric importance, since
	basically a mesh simplification process is performed backwards in
	the streaming. Consequently, the resolution of the model changes
	globally during streaming even if the client does not want to download
	detail information for the invisible parts from a given view point.
	In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for view-dependent
	streaming of multiresolution meshes. The transmission order of the

	boundary conditions for the family of so-called "three point" barycentric
	coordinates. We discuss the shortcomings of these methods and show
	how they may be rectified using an iterative scheme or a carefully

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is used to investigate the effects of
	cell deformability and viscoelasticity on receptor-mediated leukocyte
	adhesion to endothelium or a ligand coated surface in a parallel
	plate flow chamber. In the three-dimensional numerical code, a leukocyte
	is modeled as a compound viscoelastic drop (a nucleus covered by
	a thick layer of cytoplasm). The nucleus, cytoplasm, and extracellular
	fluid are considered as Newtonian or viscoelastic liquids of high
	viscosity. The receptor-ligand interaction is incorporated into the
	code by using the spring-peeling kinetic model under the assumption
	that leukocyte receptors are located on the tips of cylindrical microvilli
	distributed over the leukocyte membrane. The code is based on the
	Volume-of-Fluid method and the Giesekus constitutive equation is
	implemented in the code to capture viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm
	and nucleus. Numerical simulations demonstrate the formation and
	breakup of membrane tethers observed in vitro and suggest that the
	elasticity of the cytoplasm is responsible for a tear-drop shape
	of rolling leukocytes in vivo. When viewed from the top, as normally
	occurs during shear flow experiments in vitro, little or no deformation
	occurs, a side view shows significant deformation in the contact
	region. We show that the leukocyte membrane can be extended and disrupted
	under high shear if the receptor-ligand bonds live in a stressed
	state for a sufficiently long time. If the shear rate is low, the
	leukocyte rolls along the surface. The rolling velocity of the viscoelastic
	cell is smaller than that of the Newtonian cell. This is due to the
	increased deformability of the viscoelastic cell and, as a result,
	the decreased torque acting on this cell. PACS numbers: 87.17.Aa,

  abstract = {Good parameterizations are of central importance in many digital geometry
	processing tasks. Typically the behavior of such processing algorithms
	is related to the smoothness of the parameterization and how much
	distortion it contains. Since a parameterization maps a bounded region
	of the plane to the surface, a parameterization for a surface, which
	is not homeomorphic to a disc, must be made up of multiple pieces.
	We present a novel parameterization algorithm for arbitrary topology
	surface meshes, which computes a globally smooth parameterization
	with low distortion. We optimize the patch layout subject to criteria
	such as shape quality and metric distortion, which are used to steer
	a mesh simplification approach for base complex construction. Global
	smoothness is achieved through simultaneous relaxation over all patches,
	with suitable transition functions between patches incorporated into
	the relaxation procedure. We demonstrate the quality of our parameterizations
	through numerical evaluation of distortion measures and the excellent
	rate distortion performance of semiregular remeshes produced with
	these parameterizations. The numerical algorithms required to compute
	the parameterizations are robust and run on the order of minutes
	even for large meshes.},

	complexity of volumetric representations is independent from the
	shape complexity, the domain of a parametric representation usually
	has to have the same structure as the surface itself (which sometimes
	makes is necessary to update the domain when the surface is modified).
	On the other hand, the topology of a parametrically defined surface
	can be controlled explicitly while in a volumetric representation,
	the surface topology can change accidentally during deformation.
	A volumetric representation reduces distance queries or inside/outside

	The basic idea is to simulate the shrink wrapping process by adapting
	the deformable surface technique known from image processing. The
	resulting algorithm generates subdivision connectivity meshes whose
	base meshes only have a very small number of triangles. The iterative
	optimization process that distributes the mesh vertices over the

  abstract = {Many geometry processing applications, such as morphing, shape blending,
	transfer of texture or material properties, and fitting template
	meshes to scan data, require a bijective mapping between two or more
	models. This mapping, or cross-parameterization, typically needs
	to preserve the shape and features of the parameterized models, mapping
	legs to legs, ears to ears, and so on. Most of the applications also
	require the models to be represented by compatible meshes, i.e. meshes
	with identical connectivity, based on the cross-parameterization.
	In this paper we introduce novel methods for shape preserving cross-parameterization
	and compatible remeshing. Our cross-parameterization method computes
	a low-distortion bijective mapping between models that satisfies
	user prescribed constraints. Using this mapping, the remeshing algorithm
	preserves the user-defined feature vertex correspondence and the
	shape correlation between the models. The remeshing algorithm generates
	output meshes with significantly fewer elements compared to previous
	techniques, while accurately approximating the input geometry. As
	demonstrated by the examples, the compatible meshes we construct
	are ideally suitable for morphing and other geometry processing applications.},

  abstract = {Texture mapping enhances the visual realism of 3D models by adding
	fine details. To achieve the best results, it is often necessary
	to force a correspondence between some of the details of the texture
	and the features of the model. The most common method for mapping
	texture onto 3D meshes is to use a planar parameterization of the
	mesh. This, however, does not reflect any special correspondence
	between the mesh geometry and the texture. The matchmaker algorithm
	presented here forces user-defined feature correspondence for planar
	parameterization of meshes. This is achieved by adding positional
	constraints to the planar parameterization. Matchmaker allows users
	to introduce scores of constraints while maintaining a valid one-to-one
	mapping between the embedding and the 3D surface. Matchmaker's constraint
	mechanism can be used for other applications requiring parameterization
	besides texture mapping, such as morphing and remeshing. Matchmaker
	begins with an unconstrained planar embedding of the 3D mesh generated
	by conventional methods. It moves the constrained vertices to the
	required positions by matching a triangulation of these positions
	to a triangulation of the planar mesh formed by paths between constrained
	vertices. The matching triangulations are used to generate a new
	parameterization that satisfies the constraints while minimizing
	the deviation from the original 3D geometry.},

	and measure the required computation time. A visual evaluation of
	the tomographic slices that were produced using the new method revealed
	good registration accuracy. A comparison to tomographic slices similarly
	produced by means of conventional TACT showed identical results.
	The algorithm ran sufficiently fast on standard hardware to allow
	landmark localization in real time during successive image acquisition
	in clinical applications. The proposed method provides robust automated
	localization of landmarks in optical images. Using a hybrid imaging
	system, TACT can now be clinically applied without manual interaction
	of a human operator and without radiopaque landmarks, which might
	cover anatomic details of diagnostic interest.},

	in addition to ordinary prechecking for collision detection is used
	to avoid self-collision. Instead of avoiding self-collision of cloth
	triangles, we relax to avoid the collision of the bounding boxes
	of cloth triangles. Some constraints are enforced on the vertices

	in the direction of collision. The experimental results show that
	the relaxed self-collision avoidance method can create realistic

  abstract = {A texture atlas is an efficient color representation for 3D paint
	systems. The model to be textured is decomposed into charts homeomorphic
	to discs, each chart is parameterized, and the unfolded charts are
	packed in texture space. Existing texture atlas methods for triangulated
	surfaces suffer from several limitations, requiring them to generate
	a large number of small charts with simple borders. The discontinuities
	between the charts cause artifacts, and make it difficult to paint
	large areas with regular patterns. In this paper, our main contribution
	is a new quasi-conformal parameterization method, based on a least-squares
	approximation of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The so-defined objective
	function minimizes angle deformations, and we prove the following
	properties: the minimum is unique, independent of a similarity in
	texture space, independent of the resolution of the mesh and cannot
	generate triangle flips. The function is numerically well behaved
	and can therefore be very efficiently minimized. Our approach is
	robust, and can parameterize large charts with complex borders. We
	also introduce segmentation methods to decompose the model into charts
	with natural shapes, and a new packing algorithm to gather them in
	texture space. We demonstrate our approach applied to paint both

  abstract = {We are proposing a multiresolution representation, which uses a subdivision
	surface as a smooth base surface with respect to which a high resolution
	mesh is defined by normal displacement. While this basic representation
	is quite straightforward, our actual contribution lies in the automatic
	generation of such a representation. Given a high resolution mesh,
	our algorithm is designed to derive a subdivision control mesh whose
	structure is properly adjusted and aligned to the major geometric
	features. This implies that the control vertices of the subdivision
	surface not only control globally smooth deformations but in addition
	that these deformations are meaningful in the sense that their support

	The approach makes use of a dynamic balloon model-a spherical thin-plate-under-tension
	surface spline which deforms elastically to fit the image data. The
	fitting process is mediated by internal forces stemming from the
	elastic properties of the spline and external forces which are produced
	from the data. The forces interact in accordance with Lagrangian
	equations of motion that adjust the model's deformational degrees
	of freedom to fit the data. We employ the finite element method to
	represent the continuous surface in the form of weighted sums of
	local polynomial basis functions. We use a quintic triangular finite
	element whose nodal variables include positions as well as the first
	and second partial derivatives of the surface. We describe a system,
	implemented on a high-performance graphics workstation, which applies
	the model fitting technique to the segmentation of the cardiac left
	ventricle (LV) surface in volume (3D) CT images and LV tracking in
	dynamic volume (4D) CT images to estimate its nonrigid motion over
	the cardiac cycle. The system features a graphical user interface

	approach for studying the adhesion of a cell on a substrate is developed
	and assessed. The cellular level model consists of a continuum representation
	of the field equations and a moving boundary tracking capability
	to allow the cell to change its shape continuously. At the receptor-ligand
	level, a bond molecule is mechanically represented by a spring. Communication
	between the macro/micro- and nanoscale models is facilitated interactively
	during the computation. The computational model is assessed using
	an adherent cell, rolling and deforming along the vessel wall under
	imposed shear flows. Using this approach, we first confirm existing
	numerical and experimental results. In this study, the intracellular
	viscosity and interfacial tension are found to directly affect the
	rolling of a cell. Our results also show that the presence of a nucleus
	increases the bond lifetime, and decreases the cell rolling velocity.
	Furthermore, it is found that a cell with a larger diameter rolls
	faster, and decreases the bond lifetime. This study shows that cell
	rheological properties have significant effects on the adhesion process
	contrary to what has been hypothesized in most literature.},

	to diminish the approximation error and concentrate more samples
	in regions of high curvature. To compare the quality of the simplified
	surfaces, we have designed a new method for computing numerical and

  annote = {Existing techniques for texturing curved surfaces are either only
	applicable for a limited subset of surface representations (3d painting
	of parametric patches or dense polygonal meshes for example), or
	do not lend themselves naturally to interactive texture editing (e.g.
	procedural and solid textures). Although such methods have been used
	to produce stunning effects, there is a lack of flexible and general
	purpose tools, such as those provided by 2d image processing applications.
	This work argues that interactive texturing could benefit from a
	more cohesive paradigm built around a kernel of powerful and general
	operations. Using an analogy to the evolution of 2d painting algorithms,
	the paper motivates a framework for interactive texturing operations
	on curved surfaces and describes an approach for translating, rotating,
	and warping regions of texture (patchinos) on a surface. These ideas
	have been implemented for parametric and implicit surfaces. As an
	interesting side effect, this more unified framework also opens the
	door to a number of new interactive 3d texturing techniques that
	have no natural counterparts in two dimensions. },

	mesh using an example 2D texture. The approach is to identify interesting
	regions (texture patches) in the 2D example, and to repeatedly paste
	them onto the surface until it is completely covered. We call such
	a collection of overlapping patches a lapped texture. It is rendered
	using compositing operations, either into a traditional global texture
	map during a preprocess, or directly with the surface at runtime.
	The runtime compositing approach avoids resampling artifacts and
	drastically reduces texture memory requirements. Through a simple
	interface, the user specifies a tangential vector field over the
	surface, providing local control over the texture scale, and for
	anisotropic textures, the orientation. To paste a texture patch onto
	the surface, a surface patch is grown and parametrized over texture
	space. Specifically, we optimize the parametrization of each surface
	patch such that the tangential vector field aligns everywhere with
	the standard frame of the texture patch. We show that this optimization
	is solved efficiently as a sparse linear system.},

	We introduce a robust technique for directly parametrizing a genus-zero

	a parametrization practical is the minimization of a stretch-based
	measure, to reduce scale-distortion and thereby prevent undersampling.
	Our second contribution is a scheme for sampling the spherical domain
	using uniformly subdivided polyhedral domains, namely the tetrahedron,
	octahedron, and cube. We show that these particular semiregular samplings
	can be conveniently represented as completely regular 2D grids, i.e.
	geometry images. Moreover, these images have simple boundary extension
	rules that aid many processing operations. Applications include geometry

	mesh (PM) such that all meshes in the PM sequence share a common

	simultaneously. It minimizes texture stretch (small texture distances
	mapped onto large surface distances) to balance sampling rates over
	all locations and directions on the surface. It also minimizes texture
	deviation ("slippage" error based on parametric correspondence) to
	obtain accurate textured mesh approximations. The method begins by
	partitioning the mesh into charts using planarity and compactness
	heuristics. It creates a stretch-minimizing parametrization within
	each chart, and resizes the charts based on the resulting stretch.
	Next, it simplifies the mesh while respecting the chart boundaries.
	The parametrization is re-optimized to reduce both stretch and deviation
	over the whole PM sequence. Finally, the charts are packed into a
	texture atlas. We demonstrate using such atlases to sample color
	and normal maps over several models.},

	refinement of both meshes. By explicitly favoring low inter-surface
	distortion, we obtain maps that naturally align corresponding shape
	elements. Typically, the user need only specify a handful of feature
	correspondences for initial registration, and even these constraints
	can be removed during optimization. Our method robustly satisfies
	hard constraints if desired. Inter-surface mapping is shown using
	geometric and attribute morphs. Our general framework can also be
	applied to parametrize surfaces onto simplicial domains, such as
	coarse meshes (for semiregular remeshing), and octahedron and toroidal
	domains (for geometry image remeshing). In these settings, we obtain

  abstract = {A planar parameterization of 3D surfaces is useful for many applications.
	The applicability of the parameterization depends on how well it
	preserves the surface geometry (angles, distances, and areas). For
	most surface meshes there is no parameterization which preserves
	the geometry exactly. The distortion usually increases with the rise
	in surface complexity. For highly complicated surfaces the distortion
	can become so strong as to make the parameterization unusable for
	application's purposes. A solution is to partition the surface or
	introduce cuts in a way which reduce the distortion. We present a
	new method for cutting seams in 3D mesh surfaces. The addition of
	seams reduces the surface complexity and hence reduces the metric
	distortion produced by the parameterization. Seams often introduce
	additional constraints on the application for which the parameterization
	is used, hence their length should be minimal. The presented method
	minimizes the seam length while reducing the parameterization distortion
	to acceptable level.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method to compute planar triangulations of faceted
	surfaces for surface parameterization. In contrast to previous approaches
	that define the flattening problem as a mapping of the three-dimensional
	node locations to the plane, our method defines the flattening problem
	as a constrained optimization problem in terms of angles (only).
	After applying a scaling that derives from the 'curvature' at a node,
	we minimize the relative deformation of the angles in the plane with
	respect to their counterparts in the three-dimensional surface. This
	approach makes the method more stable and robust than previous approaches,
	which used node locations in their formulations. The new method can
	handle any manifold surface for which a connected, valid, two-dimensional
	parameterization exists, including surfaces with large curvature
	gradients. It does not require the boundary of the flat two-dimensional
	domain to be predefined or convex. We use only the necessary and
	sufficient constraints for a valid two-dimensional triangulation.
	As a result, the existence of a theoretical solution to the minimization
	procedure is guaranteed.},

	long-range attraction forces, short-range repulsion forces, and coplanarity,

	efficient triangulation scheme that connects the particles into a

	model. For this purpose, we define a new kind of (pi, beta, I)-surface.
	The partitioning of a deformable surface into a finite set of (pi,
	beta, I)-surfaces allows us to prune a large number of noncolliding
	feature pairs. This leads to a significant performance improvement
	in the collision detection process. The intrinsic collision detection
	is performed in the time domain. Although it is more expensive compared
	to the static interference test, it avoids portions of the surfaces
	passing through each other in a single time step. In order to resolve
	all the possible collision events at a given time, a penetration-free
	motion space is constructed for each colliding particle. By keeping
	the velocity of each particle inside the motion space, we guarantee
	that the current colliding feature pairs will not penetrate each
	other in the subsequent motion. A static analysis approach is adopted
	to handle friction by considering the forces acting on the particles
	and their velocities. In our formulation, we further reduce the computational
	complexity by eliminating the need to compute repulsive forces.},

	blend patches. The motivation for this choice is the fact that most
	technical CAD objects consist of patches from these four categories.
	The robust segmentation and global optimization properties which
	have been observed for the variational shape approximation carry
	over to our hybrid extension. Hence, we can use our algorithm to
	segment a given mesh model into characteristic patches and provide
	a corresponding geometric proxy for each patch. The expected result

	better approximations with a smaller number of primitives, is validated

  year = {2004},
  volume = {23},
  pages = {643-652},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {Using surface splats as a rendering primitive has gained increasing
	attention recently due to its potential for high-performance and
	high-quality rendering of complex geometric models. However, as with
	any other rendering primitive, the processing costs are still proportional
	to the number of primitives that we use to represent a given object.
	This is why complexity reduction for point-sampled geometry is as
	important as it is, e.g., for triangle meshes. In this paper we present
	a new subsampling technique for dense point clouds which is specifically
	adjusted to the particular geometric properties of circular or elliptical
	surface splats. A global optimization scheme computes an approximately
	minimal set of splats that covers the entire surface while staying
	below a globally prescribed maximum error tolerance epsiv. Since
	our algorithm converts pure point sample data into surface splats
	with normal vectors and spatial extent, it can also be considered
	as a surface reconstruction technique which generates a hole-free
	piecewise linear C/sup -1/ continuous approximation of the input
	data. Here we can exploit the higher flexibility of surface splats
	compared to triangle meshes. Compared to previous work in this area
	we are able to obtain significantly lower splat numbers for a given

	for dense point-sampled datasets. However, with increasing data complexity,

	meshes, progressive or continuous level of detail hierarchies have
	proven to be very effective when it comes to (locally) adapt the
	resolution level of the 3D model to the application-dependent quality
	requirements. In this paper we transfer this concept to splat-based
	geometry representations. Our progressive splat decimation procedure
	uses the standard greedy approach but unlike previous work, it uses
	the full splat geometry in the decimation criteria and error estimates,
	not just the splat centers. With two improved error metrics, this
	new greedy framework offers better approximation quality than other
	progressive splat decimators. It comes even close to the recently
	proposed globally optimized single-resolution sub-sampling techniques

	developed 3D scanning devices and high-resolution cameras can capture
	the complex geometry of an object and yield high-resolution images.
	However, generating a textured model from this input data is still
	a difficult problem. This task is divided into three sub-problems:
	parameterization, texture combination, and texture restoration. A
	low-distortion parameterization method is presented, which minimizes
	geometry stretch energy. Photographs of the object taken from multiple
	viewpoints under modestly uncontrolled illumination conditions are
	merged into a seamless texture using our new texture combination
	method. We also demonstrate a texture restoration method that can
	fill in missing pixel information when the input photographs do not
	provide sufficient information to cover the entire surface due to
	self-occlusion or registration errors. Our methods are fully automatic,
	except for the registration process between a 3D model and input
	photographs. We demonstrate the application of our method to human
	face models for evaluation. The techniques presented in this paper
	make a consistent and complete pipeline to generate the texture of

  number = {1},
  abstract = {Surface parameterization is necessary for many graphics tasks: texture-preserving
	simplification, remeshing, surface painting, and precomputation of
	solid textures. The stretch caused by a given parameterization determines
	the sampling rate on the surface. In this article, we present an
	automatic parameterization method for segmenting a surface into patches
	that are then flattened with little stretch. Many objects consist
	of regions of relatively simple shapes, each of which has a natural
	parameterization. Based on this observation, we describe a three-stage
	feature-based patch creation method for manifold surfaces. The first
	two stages, genus reduction and feature identification, are performed
	with the help of distance-based surface functions. In the last stage,
	we create one or two patches for each feature region based on a covariance
	matrix of the feature's surface points. To reduce stretch during
	patch unfolding, we notice that stretch is a 2*2 tensor, which in
	ideal situations is the identity. Therefore, we use the Green-Lagrange
	tensor to measure and to guide the optimization process. Furthermore,
	we allow the boundary vertices of a patch to be optimized by adding
	scaffold triangles. We demonstrate our feature-based patch creation
	and patch unfolding methods for several textured models. Finally,
	to evaluate the quality of a given parameterization, we describe
	an image-based error measure that takes into account stretch, seams,
	smoothness, packing efficiency, and surface visibility.},

  abstract = {<P></P><I>Although the control-point based parametric approach is
	used most widely in free-form surface modelling, complementary techniques
	co-exist to meet various specialised requirements. The partial differential
	equation (PDE) based modelling approach is especially suitable for
	satisfying surface boundary constraints. They are also effective
	for the generation of families of free-form surfaces, which share
	a common base and differ in their secondary features. In this paper,
	we present a fast surface modelling method using a sixth order PDE.
	This PDE provides enough degrees of freedom not only to accommodate
	tangent, but also curvature boundary conditions and offers more shape
	control parameters to serve as user controls for the manipulation
	of surface shapes. In order to achieve real-time performance, we
	have constructed a surface function and developed a high-precision
	approximate solution to the 6th order PDE. Unlike some existing PDE-based
	techniques, this resolution method can satisfy the boundary conditions
	exactly, and is able to create free-form surfaces as fast and almost
	as accurately as the closed-form (analytical) solutions. Due to the
	fact that it has sufficient degrees of freedom to accommodate the
	continuity of 3-sided and 4-sided surface patches at their boundaries,
	this method is able to model complex surfaces consisting of multiple
	patches. Compared with existing PDE-based modelling methods, this
	method is both fast and can solve a larger class of surface modelling
	problems</I>. <P></P>Categories and Subject Descriptors (according

                 fully parameterizable adaptive virtual interfaces.
                 Mediators open new possibilities for multimodal feedback
                 for control interfaces. We apply mediators in the context
                 of teleoperation of robots. The implemented prototype
